## About our Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic07.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm a 17 year old computer enthusiast who loves to spend his spare time researching the fundamental intricacies regarding the often misunderstood world of Computer Science. After a long while, I finally thought I'd share my learnings through this blog.

Provided I don't get dragged down by my A-Levels, I'll hopefully be able to regularly update the blog with any projects I've done, as well as any findings from my bouts of research into certain computing fields.
